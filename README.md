## Ideas for plugins

### Insert Map Plugin
Almost all boards like MSERT have at-least district level syllabus for Geography for 1st to 4th grade. Since it is district level, it needs to be differnt for every district.

Imagine a plugin that lets you choose state -> choose district -> and insert map of the district in the content editor.

The maps being inserted will be based on some JS library that will do map rendering using SVG and offer interactions around map.

This can enable teachers from all over India to create interactive maps for every district. 

We can either take inspiration from or ue these plugins
